# LW1 IMAGE CLASSIFICATION

*Here is my Google Collab:* [**Click Here!**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Gy2WbJjk9e3m-4VgzSG7D4WtwAMZunmT?usp=sharing)



**1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?** 
<br>*The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of small black-and-white images of clothing items like shirts, shoes, and bags. Each image is 28×28 pixels and belongs to one of 10 clothing categories. It is used to practice image classification using machine learning.*

**2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?** 
<br>*We normalize the images to change pixel values because this makes the model train faster and helps it learn better by keeping numbers small and consistent.*

**3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.** 
<br> 
- __Flatten layer__ – Changes the image into a single list of numbers.
- __Dense hidden layer__ – Learns patterns from the image.
- __Dense output layer__ – Gives the prediction for each clothing category.
