**1. What is the Fashion MNIST dataset?** 
<br>*Fashion MNIST is a set of small black and white pictures of clothes like shirts, shoes, and bags. Each picture belongs to one group. It is used to teach a computer how to recognize clothes in pictures.*

**2. Why do we normalize image pixel values before training?** 
<br>*We make the numbers smaller so the computer can learn easier and faster. Big numbers make learning harder.*

**3. List the layers used in the neural network and their functions.** 
<br> 
- __Flatten layer__ – Turns the picture into numbers.
- __Dense hidden layer__ – Helps the computer learn what the picture looks like.
- __Dense output layer__ – Tells what kind of clothing the picture is.
<br>

**4. What does an epoch mean in model training?** 
<br>*An epoch means the computer has looked at all the pictures one time.*

**5. Compare the predicted label and actual label for the first test image.** 
<br>*For the first picture, the predicted label and the actual label is the same.*

**6. What could be done to improve the model’s accuracy?** 
<br>*We can let the computer train longer, add more learning steps, or use a better way to read pictures.*
